  <h3 align="center">Optimal Placement of Security Cameras Using Vertex Cover</h3>

</p>


## About The Project

In this project, we explore three distinct methods for optimizing the placement of security cameras to ensure comprehensive coverage while minimizing costs. 

We employ **CNF SAT** with the Minisat SAT solver API for precise Boolean satisfiability assessments. 

Additionally, we implement two heuristic approaches: 

**ApproxVC1**, utilizing a greedy algorithm to select the most weighted vertex iteratively until all edges are covered, and 

**ApproxVC2**, employing a brute-force strategy to select vertices from each edge without duplication. 

Our efforts aim to provide flexible solutions tailored to various real-world scenarios, enhancing security infrastructure efficiently.
